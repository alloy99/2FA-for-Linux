|   SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:  |
-------------------------------

1)PURPOSE:
The purpose of this application is to provide an extra layer of security to the system, aimed at environments in which non-authorized access is considered a significant risk. Nonetheless, 2FA shouldn’t be considered as the ultimate security solution and should never be the only security measure in place for high-security environments.


2)CONSIDERATIONS:
It is important to understand that 2FA protects the access to your system, not your data. Therefore, while 2FA is effective against common authentication attacks (like credential brute-forcing or stealing), it cannot protect against non-authorized access to data through means that bypass the Operating System’s normal authentication methods (like reading from the hard drive directly).

Therefore, if security is to be achieved against these kind of attacks, other security measures should be considered.

3)WARRANTY:
2FA is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
